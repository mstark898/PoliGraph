Personal information means any information relating to an identified\n                or identifiable natural person (\"data subject\"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,\n                in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more\n                factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. This\n                information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also information in connection with payments.\n            \n\n            Information AdBlock collects\n\n            Personal information\n            \n                When you visit the AdBlock website we collect IP address, unique ID, logging of some of the button clicks on our website (clicking download,\n                for example) and user event logging data. When the AdBlock extension communicates with AdBlock servers, we receive the computer\u2019s IP address.\n                After six months we will remove any identifying information such as IP address from our log files and databases.\n            \n            \n                When you donate from the AdBlock website, we collect and store all information, excluding the credit card number, given during\n                the payment process. This includes IP address, unique ID, logging some of the button clicks (payment, download buttons) and user event logging.\n                AdBlock does not handle or have access to full credit card numbers, bank account details or payment account login information. Each payment\n                processor stores and uses the data you provide them differently.\n            \n            \n                AdBlock uses both Stripe and PayPal as payment processors when you donate to AdBlock. To learn more about their data collection policies,\n                please consult their respective privacy policies when using them.\n            \n\n            AdBlock Premium\n            \n                When you purchase or otherwise obtain a AdBlock Premium license AdBlock will store information regarding the license, including:\n                unique extension identifiers associated with the license, email associated with the license, last license check timestamp and license \n                status. This data will be stored during the active lifetime of the license and for a period after cancellation.\n            \n            \n                The same data that is stored when you make a donation to AdBlock is stored when you purchase Premium. \n            \n\n            AdBlock Premium - Sync\n            \n                If you elect to use the Sync feature of AdBlock Premium then AdBlock collects information about the particular extension installation, including: unique\n                extension identifier, sync device name and the timestamp of when the sync enrollment was made. This data will be stored during the active lifetime of\n                the license and for a period after cancellation.\n            \n            \n                AdBlock also stores the entire set of extension settings in plain text on our servers to accommodate the sync functionality across multiple extension\n                installations. This storage location has restricted access and is only made available to AdBlock employees to diagnose and fix errors with the sync\n                service. Every reasonable precaution is taken to secure this storage location but no database or server is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the\n                absolute security of the extension settings data. If you have concerns about the AdBlock extension settings data being compromised, since there is\n                no current mechanism to encrypt the data from the user's end, please carefully consider whether you want to use this feature.\n            \n            \n                Finally, AdBlock Premium - Sync uses PubNub for real time sync notifications. Please refer to the \n                PubNub privacy policy for information on their data collection policies. PubNub is used to alert the extension of a new settings version only \n                and does not have access to the extension settings information.\n            \n\n            AdBlock VPN\n            \n                When you purchase an AdBlock VPN license, AdBlock will store information regarding the license, including: unique identifiers associated with the license,\n                email associated with the license, last license check timestamp and license status. This data will be stored during the active lifetime of the license and\n                for a period after cancellation.\n            \n            \n                We use the analytic services from Firebase Events from Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. on an opt-in basis to analyze\n                and improve the functionality of our software and to optimize your user experience.

We also collect data related to unexpected crashes or errors to analyze and solve any malfunctions, including: app/extension version, type of device, UUID and crash traces, instance and application IDs, free space and free ram, as well as the timestamp of the crash.\n            \n            \n                Data on event tracking is deleted after 60 days. Crash reports are retained for 180 days, related Instance IDs are deleted in accordance with Firebase\u2019s retention policies.\n            \n            \n                For both event tracking and crash reporting, the data collection is solely used to improve the functionality and user experience of our mobile products and can be opted-out in the settings menu. We use the analytic services from Firebase Events from Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. on an opt-out basis to analyze and improve the functionality of our mobile applications and to optimize your user experience. In each instance, only anonymized data is utilized.\n            \n\n            Anonymous information\n            \n                The AdBlock extension captures anonymous usage information including, but not limited to, the version number of the extension, preferred language,\n                Acceptable Ads opt-in, opt-in to advanced features like our local content caching service, number of blocked requests, number of ads blocked, and\n                browser and operating system type. The AdBlock extension also assigns an anonymous, unique ID to each installation. We store aggregate statistics\n                about the installation connected with each user ID indefinitely. We utilize this information to help us identify and fix potential issues with\n                AdBlock as well as to determine the performance of AdBlock features.\n            \n            \n                The iOS extension captures connection type (wifi or mobile) in addition to the data that the browser extension captures.\n            \n\n            Extension error information\n            \n                An error report is automatically sent to AdBlock's servers whenever an error occurs in the extension. The report contains the anonymous\n                information stated previously along with the current browser version and a description of the error. If a URL exists in the error description\n                then the extension will attempt to remove it. The data is used for troubleshooting and to identify general defects which lead to unexpected\n                crashes or errors. After 7 days we will remove this information from our log files and databases.\n            \n\n            Server logs\n            \n                Logs for general requests made to getadblock.com or its infrastructure are kept for up to 90 days. These logs include the IP address, browser,\n                operating system, and page address. We will anonymize the IP address by using a hash to encrypt this information and we will immediately\n                delete the original IP address. This data is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues. After\n                90 days, we will remove this information from our log files and databases.\n            \n            \n                Logs for payment processing requests are kept in accordance with US tax law retention periods and will be deleted after the end of the\n                respective retention period. Information in these logs includes IP address, email (if provided), address (if provided), name (if provided),\n                browser type and version, operating system, payment amount, payment type, card type, expiration date, and last four digits of the card if a card is used.\n                This data is used to provide insights into the financial performance of AdBlock.\n            \n\n            Analytics\n            \n                AdBlock uses Google Analytics to aggregate information about traffic patterns and how our website, extensions, and mobile applications are used. We limit the data sent to Google Analytics, and only do so to improve our extension and website.
