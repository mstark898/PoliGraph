<br><b>Data transfers</b><br>
<br><i>Transfers to the United States</i><br>
<br>For personal data about EEA, Swiss and UK individuals, we comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, each as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the “<b>Frameworks</b>”), regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland in reliance on the Frameworks.&nbsp;<br>
<br>As described in Superhuman Platform Inc.’s Frameworks certification, we have certified that we adhere to the Frameworks Principles with respect to such information. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program and to view our certification, please visit <a rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-color_linkDefault__xgSfW link-color_styles2024__s1yEi" target="_blank" href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/"><u>https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</u></a>.<br>
<br>In compliance with the Frameworks, we commit to resolve complaints about our processing of your personal data under the Frameworks.

<br>Under the Frameworks, we commit to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received under the Frameworks to VeraSafe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please visit <a rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-color_linkDefault__xgSfW link-color_styles2024__s1yEi" target="_blank" href="https://verasafe.com/public-resources/dispute-resolution/submit-dispute/"><u>here</u></a> for more information or to file a complaint.<br>
<br>If your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under certain conditions, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Data Privacy Framework Panel.
